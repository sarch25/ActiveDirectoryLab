<h1>Active Directory with PowerShell</h1>

## Summary

Created a home lab environment using Oracle VirtualBox with two virtual machines: Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10. Configured Windows Server 2019 as a Domain Controller, setting up Active Directory for centralized resource and user management. 

Implemented network services, including NAT, routing, and DHCP, to enable seamless IP assignment and connectivity within the private network. 

Automated user management by creating 1,000 Active Directory users via a PowerShell script. Successfully integrated the Windows 10 client into the domain, completing the Active Directory infrastructure setup.

This project demonstrates foundational IT and cybersecurity skills, emphasizing proficiency in deploying and managing corporate level infrastructure. It highlights skills in user and resource management, secure network configuration, and automationâ€”critical competencies for ensuring efficient and secure IT operations in real-world environments.
